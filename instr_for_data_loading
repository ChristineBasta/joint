include generic.sh in scripts
include input-from-sgm-documents.perl to add the titles
For data , we should get it in the format we are working with, other than this, we will try to make the dictionary in another way:
1- Tokenize,  truecase

2- Add src token to src, target token to target
4- clean after the tagging as sometimes title and description tags are swapped
5-bpe to src and target
prepare the valid and test
4-form the dictionaries

notes:
sometimes the lines are empty in the src and tgr files and these lines are not written in the prepared files and thus deteriorates the paralel language files

if any of the files do not have tab title at the end, please add
<title> last title</title>
